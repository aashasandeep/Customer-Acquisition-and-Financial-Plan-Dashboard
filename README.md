Customer-Acquisition-and-Financial-Plan-Dashboard
Background:

AcmeTech is launching a digital marketing campaign to scale customer acquisition in the next quarter. As part of the Growth team, your task is to develop a financial plan to acquire 1,000 new paid customers while ensuring the campaign's financial viability.

Management has provided key data points, and your role involves performing the necessary calculations, building a mini dashboard, and providing a data-driven recommendation on the campaign’s feasibility.

Key Components:

✔ LTV Calculation: Estimated the average revenue per customer based on subscription fees and churn rate.

✔ Ad Budget Estimation: Determined the total budget required using two methods—CAC-based and CPM-based calculations.

✔ Profit/Loss Forecasting: Analyzed the return on investment (ROI) and the overall feasibility of the campaign.

✔ Dynamic Dashboard: Developed an interactive Google Sheets dashboard featuring key financial metrics, LTV comparisons across customer segments (Premium, Standard, Trial), XLOOKUP functionality, and data visualization for better decision-making.

Key Insights & Takeaways:

✔ The CAC-based budget led to a net loss, while the CPM-based budget showed potential profitability.

✔ Premium customers have the highest LTV, reinforcing the need for targeted marketing strategies.

✔ The dashboard provides real-time insights, making it easier to adjust marketing spend dynamically.

Final Insights & Recommendations:

✔ The analysis revealed that CAC-based budgeting resulted in a net loss, while CPM-based budgeting showed profitability.

✔ The dashboard provides real-time insights into financial metrics, allowing decision-makers to optimize ad spending and pricing strategies.

✔ The project showcases data-driven financial decision-making, useful for growth strategy and digital marketing planning.
